# ðŸŒ± SEED â€” Sustainability Evaluation for Early-stage Decisions

SEED is a **Streamlit-based tool** to support **qualitative sustainability assessment** of new materials and products at **low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)**.

The goal is to help researchers and innovators:
- Engage the right **actors** early in development.
- Define a clear **core function** and **functional unit** before detailed LCA is feasible.
- Identify **environmental, social, and economic trade-offs**.
- Highlight **worst-performing lifecycle stages** early, enabling design adjustments when design freedom is still high.

This tool is useful for **research proposals**, where claims about sustainability need justification, but a full LCA is not yet possible.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Step 1 â€” TRL & actors**  
  Define TRL and see which actors to involve.

- **Step 2 â€” Scoping & lifecycle**  
  Define the **core function** and **functional unit**, and map up to 7 lifecycle stages.

- **Step 3 â€” Select factors**  
  Choose 3 key Environmental, Social, and Economic factors (guided by definitions).

- **Step 4 â€” Scoring grid**  
  Score each factor per stage (1 = Much Worse â€¦ 5 = Much Better) vs. baseline.  
  *A dashed baseline at 3 makes trade-offs clear.*

- **Step 5 â€” Results & plots**  
  - Horizontal bar plots, centered at the baseline of 3.  
  - Red (<2), Orange (2â€“4), Green (>4).  
  - Highlight worst and best stages.  
  - Export results as **JSON** or **Markdown report**.

- **Import/Export** projects to JSON for collaboration.

- Includes an **example project** on recyclable wind turbine blades.
